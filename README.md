## Power Supplies
  ### DC Input Supply (Vdc)
      DC Voltage                 = 1.5 V
      AC Magnitude               = 0 V
      Number of Noise/freq pairs = 0
  ### Input Bit Source (Vbit)
      Pattern Parameter data     = 100100100
      Pattern Parameter rptstart = 1
      Pattern Parameter rpttimes = 0
      Trigger                    = Internal
      Number of Periodic Jitters = 0
      One value                  = 1.5 V
      Zero Value                 = 0 V
      Period                     = 18 ns
      
## Key Achievements: 90nm 
1. Achieved an Average power consumption(P) of 27.46 x 10 ^ -6 W at Fast Fast(FF) corner Analysis.
2. Obtained a minimum Propagation Delay(D) of 9.047 ns (Rise to Fall Edge) and 9.057 ns (Fall to Rise Edge).

## Applications:
Optimized for Practical Use: Designed for low power, high speed, and reliable operation, suitable for digital pattern recognition applications.
